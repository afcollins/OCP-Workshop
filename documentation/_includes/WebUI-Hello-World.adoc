= WebUI: Hello World

This unit will mimic (as closely as possible) the exerices done in the CLI version of Hello World.

The objective is to step through everything needed to bring a "Hello, World!" program online in our Openshift Container Platform. Again, we are going to do it several different ways to illustrate some best and worst practices of container usage.

There are 4 fundamental steps to deploying an application in the Openshift Container Platform via the WebUI:

  . **login** - sign-on with proper credentials
  . **Create a Project**
  . **Create an Application**
  . **Expose a Route**

Let's get started.

== My First Application

=== Sign-on as admin

If you have not already done so, please proceed to login to the Openshift WebUI as user *admin*.  Instructions for doing so are outlined in the unit *WebUI: First Time Login*.

====
image::ocp-webui-login-04.png[Login]
====

=== Create a Project

You can always get to the *Openshift Landing* page by clicking on the "Openshift Container Platform" logo in the top left corner.  

____
Select `Create Project` from *My Projects* on the *Openshift Landing* page

Use the following details:

.Key-Values for Create Project
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI
*Description*:: My First WebUI App

Select `Create` when complete
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====


You should notice that your new project "Hello WebUI" has been added to the list on the right.

____
Select project `Hello WebUI` from *My Projects* on the *Openshift Landing* page
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-select.png[Select Project]
====

=== Create an Application

After selecting a project, the WebUI changes it's layout to 3 main elements and their components:

  . *Banner*
  ** *Logo:* Openshift Container Platform
  ** *Help* pull down
  ** *Profile and Administrative* pull down
  . *Navigation Bar*
  ** *Navicon*
  ** *Projects* pull down
  ** *Search Catalog*
  ** *Add to Project* pull down
  . *Menu*
  ** *Overview*
  ** *Applications*
  ** *Builds*
  ** *Resources*
  ** *Storage*
  ** *Monitoring*
  ** *Catalog*
  
As noted, the current working project is indicated in the pull down on the *Navigation Bar*.  This is important to monitor to ensure your actions are being applied to the correct project.

For the purposes of these introductory exercises, we are focused on `Applications`, `Builds` and `Storage`.  Other attributes of a *Project* will be covered in later units.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-image-deploy.png[Image Deploy]
====

____
Select `Deploy Image` from project *Overview* page

Select `Image Name` radio button

Use the following datails:

.Key-Values for Image Specification
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

Press `Return` after entering the image name
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-image-name.png[Image Name]
====

If the image name was entered correctly, when you press `Return` (or hit the `Search` icon) you will see a brief summary of the specified image and additional parameters will appear in order to complete this phase.  Scroll down a bit and change the resource *Name* as shown below.

____
Complete the data entry with the following details:

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui

Select `Deploy` 

Select the `Continue to Project Overview` link
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-resource-name.png[Resource Name]
====

The *Project Overview* page provides a high-level view of the project you just created including quick links to the *Deployment Config*, *Services*, *Routes*, *Pods* and more.  Take a moment to look it over and familiarize yourself with it.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-overview.png[Project Overview]
====

You just completed configuring Openshift to create a new application called *webui-hello* based on a container image named *httpd-24-rhel7* being pulled from *registry.access.redhat.com*.  There is actually a lot more going on behind the scenes, but for now we'll be satisfied with fact you've initiated the build and deployment of a containerized application.

=== Expose a Route

Time to configure a *route* and expose our new application to the network.

____
Select `Create Route` from project *Overview*

Use the following details (leave defaults unless specified otherwise):

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui
*Hostname*:: hello-webui.cloud.example.com

Select `Create`
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-route-details.png[Create Route]
====

You should be returned to the Routes Overview page as shown.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-routes-overview.png[Create Route]
====

=== Validate Application

Provided that you have not been too efficient and completed exposing the route before the build finished, you can now click on the URL provided in the *Hostname* column to verify that the application is working as expected.

You should see the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux Test Page.  If you get an error response, it is probably an indication that the build is still in progress.  Just wait a minute and try again.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-verification.png[Application Verification]
====

=== Exploring the Container

On the left menu, mouse-over and select *Applications->Pods*.  Now click on the pod link to bring up it's details.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-pod-overview.png[Pod Overview]
====

One of the options in the pod details is to connect to the active pods terminal.  Proceed to click on `Terminal`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-pod-terminal.png[Pod Overview]
====

Now that you have connected to the active container, have a look around.  These are identical exercises to those performed in the CLI version of hellow-world.  If you are familiar with the terminal activites you can skip to **Making an authentic "Hello, World!"**.

Here are a few commands to explore the container's namespace (ie: environment).

.sh-4.2$
----
id
----

.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]
----
uid=1000120000 gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1000120000
----

.sh-4.2$
----
ps -ef

default      84     74  0 17:50 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
----

Normally files serverd by httpd go into /var/www/html, but the security-conscious random uid does not have permissions to write to this directory (or any other directory than the tmp dirs).

.sh-4.2$
----
cd /var/www/
    
ls -la

echo "Can I create a file" > testfile
----

.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]
----
total 0
drwxr-xr-x.  4 default root  33 Jul 17 17:12 .
drwxr-xr-x. 19 root    root 249 Jul 17 17:13 ..
drwxr-xr-x.  2 default root   6 May  9 13:18 cgi-bin
drwxr-xr-x.  2 default root   6 May  9 13:18 html

sh: testfile: Permission denied
----

The primary thing we are trying to point out here is that the UID the process is running with (ie: **1000120000**) does not have permissions to write to any part of the container filesystem except traditionally open directories like **/tmp** or **/var/tmp**.  In effect, that makes this base container alone rather useless for running real world applications.

Next, you will do a series of exercises detailing how to make adjustments to the project in order to deploy a real helloworld applications.

[Discrete]
== Deploying authentic "Hello, World!" Applications

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// --- Authentic Solution #1
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Hello-WebUI I : Change Security Attribute

The Openshift WebUI does not provide a native dialog for modifying all project attributes.  So, for this first objective you are either left with steps outlined in the CLI Helloworld exercises (ie: *oc edit namespace webui-hello*) OR using the `Import YAML/JSON` functionality of the WebUI.  

For our first solution, we are going to adjust the current project's security attribute by importing a YAML config file.

Proceed to click on the left menu `Overview` tab.  The main bar across the top should still show *Hello WebUI* as our selected project.   In the upper right corner you should see a pull-down labeled `Add to Project`.  From there, select `Import YAML/JSON`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-add-to-project.png[Add To Project]
====

Now you can either type in the YAML configuration file, but for convenience one has been provided.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-yaml-import.png[Import YAML]
====

User the `Browse` button to find and load the following file.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Filename*:: /var/tmp/webui-hello-namespace.txt

Once the file has been loaded, proceed to click on `Create`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-yaml-create.png[Import YAML Create]
====
    
A Confirmation dialog will appear to which we will simply clink on `Replace`.

Now click on `Close` and you will be returned to the project overview page.

Since our modification only affected "Project" attributes, nothing triggered an automatice redeployment of the application.  Thus, you will need to initiate a new deployment manually.  

From the *Project Overview* page, click on the three vertical dots on the far right of the deployment configuration, and select `Deploy`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-redeploy.png[Re-Deploy]
====

What you have done by modifying the project security attributes is configure the effective UID of deployed application to be 1001 which now enables permission to write in /var/www/html.  It is not as insecure as enabling root priviledges, but already far less secure than then previous configuration.

Let us proceed with completing our first "helloworld" deployment.

Mouse-over and select *Applications->Pods*.

Here you can use the `Terminal` feature to access a shell, poke around and install a helloworld *index.html*.  

.sh-4.2$
----
curl helloworld3.cloud.example.com > /var/www/html/index.html
----

If you didn't notice, the source for *index.html* came from an application that was deployed during the CLI exercises.  Final step is to verify the application is functioning as expected.

From the *Project Overview* page, click on the link (http://hello-webui2.cloud.example.com) provided on the right side above the Deployment Config line.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-verification2.png[Verification]
====

IMPORTANT: The solution you just completed is NOT a recommended solution on how to deploy a container for production use.  This solution was provided to touch on a few concepts unique to the Openshift Container Platform.  Take some time to review: container design, project attributes, process uid/gid (ie: namespaces) in a containerized environment, filesystems, etc...

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// --- Authentic Solution #2
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Hello-WebUI II : Use emptyDir

As noted in solution #1, there is a security issue with the default UID and the filesystem permissions in base container's directory /var/www/html.  Solution #1 attacked the problem by changing the UID of the running process.

In this solution, we are going to create a volume (ie: filesystem) which provides sufficient read/write permissions for the default (and more secure) UID.

We begin this solution by repeating the steps to deploy a httpd base image.

=== Create a Project

____
Select `Create Project` from *My Projects* on the *Openshift Landing* page

Use the following details:

.Key-Values for Create Project
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui2
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI II
*Description*:: My Second WebUI App

Select `Create` when complete
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====

You should notice that your new project "Hello WebUI II" has been added to the list on the right.  

____
Select project `Hello WebUI II` from *My Projects* on the *Openshift Landing* page
____

=== Create an Application

____
Select `Deploy Image` from project *Overview* page

Select `Image Name` radio button

Use the following datails:

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

Press `Return` after entering the image name
____

If the image name was entered correctly, when you press `Return` (or hit the `Search` icon) you will see a brief summary of the specified image and additional parameters will appear in order to complete this phase.  Scroll down a bit and change the resource *Name* as shown below.

____
.Key-Values for Application Configuration

Use the following details (leave defaults unless specified otherwise):

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui2
*Hostname*:: hello-webui2.cloud.example.com

Select `Create`
____

You should be returned to the Routes Overview page as shown.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-routes-overview.png[Create Route]
====

Now comes the step of configuring our new volume (ie: filesystem).  For this purpose we are utilizing a special type of volume called an "emptyDir".  This type of volume is created when a Pod is assigned to a Node, and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node.  What does that mean?  It means that the volume is *NOT* persistent and that data stored in the volume will be lost when the pod is stopped.  It also means that the volume will be *empty* when the pod starts (hence the name: emptyDir).

For real world use cases, emptyDir is often used as a local cache.  Since the backing store for emptyDir comes from the local host it is often more performant than network base storage.

Never the less, it suits our needs for this exercise so let's proceed to configure an emptyDir.  The WebUI does not provide a ellegant solution configuring an emptyDir, so we will resort to editing the deployment configuration YAML.

____
Mouse-over and select `Applications`->`Deployments`

Select `hello-webui2` deployment

Select `Edit Yaml` from `Actions` pull-down
____

In the editing block (window), scroll down to line 44 or thereabouts and find *name: hello-webui2*.  On the next line, insert the following block:

.Edit YAML File
[source,yaml,indent=4]
----
volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /var/www/html
    name: hello-webui2-vol
----

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-yaml-edit1.png[YAML Edit 1]
====

Now scroll down to line 60 or thereabouts and find **terminationGracePeriodSeconds**.  On the next line, insert the following block:

.Edit YAML File Continued
[source,yaml,indent=4]
----
volumes:
  - name: hello-webui2-vol
    emptyDir: {}
----

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-yaml-edit2.png[YAML Edit 2]
====

____
Select `Save`.  
____

Provided there are no errors, updating the deployment configuation like this will automatically trigger a new deployment of our application.

____
Mouse-over and select `Applications`->`Pods`

Select Pod

Select `Terminal` tab from Pod details
____

From here you can access the shell, inspect the filesystem mounted on /var/www/html and install a helloworld *index.html* as shown below.

.sh-4.2$
----
curl helloworld3.cloud.example.com > /var/www/html/index.html
----

Mission accomplished.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-verification2.png[Verification]
====

IMPORTANT:  Again, it is critical to understand that this is also NOT a recommended solution to deploying an application into production on Openshift.  This solution utilizes an emptyDir storage volume which is non-persistent.  If the application is stopped and restarted, fails and restarts, is scaled up ... the changes you introduced to the single image by manually copying index.html to the image will not be replicated or restored.

== Hello-WebUI III : Use NFS

=== Create Project

____
Select `Create Project` from *My Projects* on the *Openshift Landing* page

Use the following details:

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui3
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI III
*Description*:: My Third WebUI App

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====

You should notice that your new project "Hello WebUI III" has been added to the list on the right.

____
Select project `Hello WebUI III` from *My Projects* on the *Openshift Landing* page
____

=== Create Application

As before, the next step is to `Deploy Image`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-yaml-import.png[Import YAML]
====

.Key-Values for Deploy Image
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

After typing in the Image Name, click the search icon to populate the image details and expose additional options.

Scroll down and change the application name as follows.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui3

Now click 'Deploy' and `Continue to the project overview`.

==== Create Persistent Volume (PV)

Fundamentally, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used.  In soluttion #2, we use a volume type of "emptyDir".

In the language of Kubernettes, a PV is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator. It is a resource in the cluster.  A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user (deployment).

Lastly, Persistent Volumes (PV) are "cluster" objects and thus are not namespaced (ie: they don't belong to projects).  They belong to, and are available to,  the whole cluster.

If all of this is confusing, don't worry about it now.  What it boils down to is that storage configuration in Openshift behaves like 2 magenets.  You have to configure a PV (with certain attributes) and a PVC (with certain attributes).  Once configured, if the attributes of a PV and PVC match then like magnets they'll find each other and bind.  Once a PV and PVC are bound, the volume is ready for use.

The WebUI does not currently provide a convinient dialog for creating PVs, thus we will import a YAML configuration file similar to what was does in the CLI counterpart to this exercise.

____
Select `Import YAML/JSON` from project *Overview* page

=== Hello-WebUI V : Use Dockerfile

So this solution is a bit more complicated.  As shown during the CLI exercises, deploying an application
based on a Dockerfile is pretty trivial.  In fact, the `oc new-app` commandline was the shortest and had the least amount of typing of all the CLI helloworld examples.

Using the WebUI, there is currently no method to natively invoke a *Docker Build Strategy*.  Thus we are left with the option of importing a YAML configuration file.  Once again, this workshop has provided a sample file to make the exercise fairly simply to execute.  However, we are going to spend some time discussing it in detail.  This will hopefully shed some light on how Openshift (ie: Kubernettes) functions.

First let us begin with how this YAML file was built.  That's simple, we used the `oc new-app` CLI tool.

.[root@workstation ~]#
----
oc login master:8443 -u admin
     
oc new-app https://github.com/xtophd/OCP-Workshop --context-dir=/src/dockerfile --name=hello-webui5 --dry-run -o yaml
----

The output of the above command is listed below.  Step through it and notice the individual stanzas (denoted by the leading '-').  There are sections for: 

  * ImageStream (for the source base php image)
  * ImageStream (for the final deployable image (ie: output))
  * BuildConfig
  ** note "dockerStrategy"
  ** note dockerStrategy "from"
  ** note git "uri" and "contextDir"
  ** note the "output"
  * DeploymentConfig
  ** note the number of "replicas"
  ** note the reference to the "image", the "ports"
  ** note the triggers
  * Service

The reasons for noting specific items in each stanza is simply to point out the relationships between them.
The only step (definition) missing to having a completely deployed application at the end of ingesting this YAML is the exposed *route* which connects the outside world to the pod's *service*.

Review the output below and discuss each section.  Then proceed to the steps towards deploying the application.
