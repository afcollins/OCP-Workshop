= WebUI: Hello World

This unit will mimic (as closely as possible) the exerices done in the CLI version of Hello World.

The objective is to step through everything needed to bring a "Hello, World!" program online in our Openshift Container Platform. Again, we are going to do it several different ways to illustrate some best and worst practices of container usage.

There are 4 fundamental steps to deploying an application in the Openshift Container Platform via the WebUI:

  . **login** - sign-on with proper credentials
  . **Create a Project**
  . **Create an Application**
  . **Expose a Route**

Let's get started.

== My First Application

=== Sign-on as admin

Please proceed to login to the Openshift WebUI as user *admin*.  Instructions for doing so are outlined in the unit *WebUI: First Time Login*.

====
image::ocp-webui-login-04.png[Login]
====

=== Create a Project

Go To Front Landing Page and select `Create Project`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI
*Description*:: My First WebUI App

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right.  Now select the new `HelloWebUI` project from the list on the right to continue to the next step.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-select.png[Select Project]
====

=== Create an Application

The next step is to select `Deploy Image`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-image-deploy.png[Image Deploy]
====

Next you will be prompted for image name.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-image-name.png[Image Name]
====

Click the radio button next to `Image Name` and enter the values as shown below.

.Key-Values for Image Selection
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

Click the `Search` icon to advance to the final phase of this deployment.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-resource-name.png[Resource Name]
====

Now you are presented with a description of the specified image.  Scroll down a bit and change the *Name* as shown below.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui

Click `Deploy` and then `Continue to Project Overview`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-overview.png[Project Overview]
====

You just completed configuring Openshift to create a new application called *webui-hello* based on a container image named *httpd-24-rhel7* being pulled from *registry.access.redhat.com*.  There is actually a lot more going on behind the scenes, but for now we'll be satisfied with fact you've initiated the build of a containerized application.

=== Expose a Route

Time to configure a *route* and expose our new application to the network.  On the left menu, mouse-over and select  *Applications->Routes*.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-routes.png[Application Routes]
====

Proceed to click on `Create Route`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-route-create.png[Create Route]
====

After clicking on `Create Route` you will be prompted for some details.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-route-details.png[Create Route]
====

Fill in the details as follows (using defaults unless specified otherwise).

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui
*Hostname*:: hello-webui.cloud.example.com

Proceed to click `Create`.  You should be returned to the Routes Overview page as shown.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-routes-overview.png[Create Route]
====

=== Validate Application

Provided that you have not been too efficient and completed exposing the route before the build finished, you can now click on the URL provided in the **Hostname** column to verify that the application is working as expected.

You should see the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux Test Page.  If you get an error response, it is probably an indication that the build is still in progress.  Just wait a minute and try again.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-verification.png[Application Verification]
====

=== Exploring the Container

On the left menu, mouse-over and select *Applications->Pods*.  Now click on the pod link to bring up it's details.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-pod-overview.png[Pod Overview]
====

One of the options in the pod details is to connect to the active pods terminal.  Proceed to click on `Terminal`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-pod-terminal.png[Pod Overview]
====

Now that you have connected to the active container, have a look around.  These are identical exercises to those performed in the CLI version of hellow-world.  If you are familiar with the terminal activites you can skip to **Making an authentic "Hello, World!"**.

Here are a few commands to explore the container's namespace (ie: environment).

.sh-4.2$

default      84     74  0 17:50 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
----

Normally files serverd by httpd go into /var/www/html, but the security-conscious random uid does not have permissions to write to this directory (or any other directory than the tmp dirs).

.sh-4.2$
----
cd /var/www/
    
ls -la

echo "Can I create a file" > testfile
----

.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]
----
total 0
drwxr-xr-x.  4 default root  33 Jul 17 17:12 .
drwxr-xr-x. 19 root    root 249 Jul 17 17:13 ..
drwxr-xr-x.  2 default root   6 May  9 13:18 cgi-bin
drwxr-xr-x.  2 default root   6 May  9 13:18 html

sh: testfile: Permission denied
----

The primary thing we are trying to point out here is that the UID the process is running with (ie: **1000120000**) does not have permissions to write to any part of the container filesystem except traditionally open directories like **/tmp** or **/var/tmp**.  In effect, that makes this base container alone rather useless for running real world applications.

Next, you will do a series of exercises detailing how to make adjustments to the project in order to deploy a real helloworld applications.

== Making an authentic "Hello, World!"

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// --- Authentic Solution #1
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Solution #1: Change Security Attribute

The Openshift WebUI does not provide a native dialog for modifying all project attributes.  So, for this first objective you are either left with steps outlined in the CLI Helloworld exercises (ie: *oc edit namespace webui-hello*) OR using the `Import YAML/JSON` functionality of the WebUI.  

For our first solution, we are going to adjust the current project's security attribute by importing a YAML config file.

Proceed to click on the left menu `Overview` tab.  The main bar across the top should still show *Hello WebUI* as our selected project.   In the upper right corner you should see a pull-down labeled `Add to Project`.  From there, select `Import YAML/JSON`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-add-to-project.png[Add To Project]
====

Now you can either type in the YAML configuration file, but for convenience one has been provided.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-yaml-import.png[Import YAML]
====

User the `Browse` button to find and load the following file.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Filename*:: /var/tmp/webui-hello-namespace.txt

Once the file has been loaded, proceed to click on `Create`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-yaml-create.png[Import YAML Create]
====
    
A Confirmation dialog will appear to which we will simply clink on `Replace`.

Now click on `Close` and you will be returned to the project overview page.

Since our modification only affected "Project" attributes, nothing triggered an automatice redeployment of the application.  Thus, you will need to initiate a new deployment manually.  

From the *Project Overview* page, click on the three vertical dots on the far right of the deployment configuration, and select `Deploy`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-redeploy.png[Re-Deploy]
====

What you have done by modifying the project security attributes is configure the effective UID of deployed application to be 1001 which now enables permission to write in /var/www/html.  It is not as insecure as enabling root priviledges, but already far less secure than then previous configuration.

Let us proceed with completing our first "helloworld" deployment.

Mouse-over and select *Applications->Pods*.

Here you can use the `Terminal` feature to access a shell, poke around and install a helloworld *index.html*.  

.sh-4.2$
----
curl helloworld3.cloud.example.com > /var/www/html/index.html
----

If you didn't notice, the source for *index.html* came from an application that was deployed during the CLI exercises.  Final set is to verify the application is function as expected.

From the *Project Overview* page, click on the link (http://hello-webui2.cloud.example.com) provided on the right side above the Deployment Config line.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-verification2.png[Verification]
====

IMPORTANT: The solution you just completed is NOT a recommended solution on how to deploy a container for production use.  This solution was provided to touch on a few concepts unique to the Openshift Container Platform.  Take some time to review: container design, project attributes, process uid/gid (ie: namespaces) in a containerized environment, filesystems, etc...

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// --- Authentic Solution #2
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Solution #2: Use emptyDir

As noted in solution #1, there is a security issue with the default UID and the filesystem permissions in base container's directory /var/www/html.  Solution #1 attacked the problems by changing the UID of the running process.

In this solution, we are going to create a volume (ie: filesystem) which provides sufficient read/write permissions for the default (and more secure) UID.

We begin this solution by repeating the steps to deploy a httpd base image.

=== Create a Project

Go To Front Landing Page and select `Create Project`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui2
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI II
*Description*:: My Second WebUI App

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right.  Now select the new `Wello WebUI II` project from the list on the right to continue to the next step.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

=== Create an Application

The next step is to select `Deploy Image` and fill in the following details.

Click the radio button next to `Image Name` and enter the values as shown below.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

Click the `Search` icon to advance to the final phase of this deployment.

Now you are presented with a description of the specified image.  Scroll down a bit and change the *Name* as shown below.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui2

Click `Deploy` and then `Continue to Project Overview`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-project-overview.png[Project Overview]
====

=== Expose a Route

On the left menu, mouse-over and select  *Applications->Routes*.

Proceed to click on `Create Route`.

Fill in the details as follows (using defaults unless specified otherwise).

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui2
*Hostname*:: hello-webui.cloud.example.com

Proceed to click `Create`.  You should be returned to the Routes Overview page as shown.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-routes-overview.png[Create Route]
====

Now comes the step of configuring our new volume (ie: filesystem).  For this purpose we are utilizing a special type of volume called an "emptyDir".  This type of volume is created when a Pod is assigned to a Node, and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node.  What does that mean?  It means that the volume is *NOT* persistent and that data stored in the volume will be lost when the pod is stopped.  It also means that the volume will be *empty* when the pod starts (hence the name: emptyDir).

For real world use cases, emptyDir is often used as a local cache.  Since the backing store for emptyDir comes from the local host it is often more performant than network base storage.

Never the less, it suits our needs for this exercise so let's proceed to configure an emptyDir.  The WebUI does not provide a ellegant solution configuring an emptyDir, so we will resort to editing the deployment configuration YAML.

Mouse-over and select *Applications->Deployments*

Select the `hello-webui2` deployment

From the `Actions` pull-down, select `Edit Yaml`

In the editing block (window), scroll down to line 44 or thereabouts and find *namd: hello-webui2*.  On the next line, insert the following block:

.Edit YAML File
[source,yaml,indent=4]
----
volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /var/www/html
    name: hellow-webui2-vol
----

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-yaml-edit1.png[YAML Edit 1]
====

Now scroll down to line 60 or thereabouts and find **terminationGracePeriodSeconds**.  On the next line, insert the following block:

.Edit YAML File Continued
[source,yaml,indent=4]
----
volumes:
  - name: hello-webui2-vol
    emptyDir: {}
----

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-yaml-edit2.png[YAML Edit 2]
====

Select `Save`.  Provided there are no errors, updating the deployment configuation like this will automatically trigger a new deployment of our application.

Mouse-over and select *Applications->Pods*

Select the Pod and then use the `Terminal` feature found in the Pod Details page.  From there you can access the shell, inspect the filesystem mounted on /var/www/html and install a helloworld *index.html* as shown below.

.sh-4.2$
----
curl helloworld3.cloud.example.com > /var/www/html/index.html
----

Mission accomplished.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-verification2.png[Verification]
====

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// --- Authentic Solution #3
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Solution #3: Use NFS

==== Create Project

From the Openshift Front Landing page select `Create` a project as before.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui3
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI III
*Description*:: My Third WebUI App

Once the project is created, proceed to select the project on the right.

==== Create Persistent Volume (PV)

Fundamentally, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used.  In soluttion #1, we use a volume type of "emptyDir".

In the language of Kubernettes, a PV is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator. It is a resource in the cluster.  A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user (deployment).

Lastly, Persistent Volumes (PV) are "cluster" objects and thus are not namespaced (ie: they don't belong to projects).  They belong to are are available to the whole cluster.

If all of this is confusing, don't worry about it.  What it boils down to is that storage is like a 2 magenets.  The have to configure a PV (with certain attributes) and a PVC (with certain attributes).  Then if the attributes match, like magnets they'll find each other and bind.  Once a PV and PVC are bound, the volume is ready for use.

The WebUI does not currently provide a convinient dialog for creating PVs, thus we will import a YAML configuration file similar to what was does in the CLI counterpart to this exercise.

From the *Project Overview* page select `Import YAML/JSON`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-yaml-import.png[Import YAML]
====

A sample YAML file is provided on the workstation to make this process easy.  Use the `Browse` button on the search bar to locate: **/var/tmp/nfs-pv-02.txt**

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-yaml-pv.png[Create PV]
====

Proceed to click on `Create`.  You will get a warning message requesting confirmation, click `Create Anyway`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-yaml-confirmation.png[Confirm PV]
====

Now click on `Close" and continue with your image deployment.

==== Create Application

As before, the next step is to `Deploy Image`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-yaml-import.png[Import YAML]
====

.Key-Values for Deploy Image
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

After typing in the Image Name, click the search icon to populate the image details and expose additional options.

Scroll down and change the application name as follows.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui3

Now click 'Deploy' and `Continue to the project overview`.

==== Create Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

Mouse-over and select *Applications->Deployments*.  

Select our deployment configuration *hello-webui3*.

Now click on the `Actions` pull down and select `Add Storage`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-storage-add.png[Add Storage]
====

Since we have not configured a PVC for our use, you will be directed to the *Create Storage* page.

Select `Create Storage` and you will be presented a dialog for setting up a persistent volume claim (PVC).

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-storage-pvc.png[Create Storage]
====

Use the following parameters.

.Key-Values for Create Storage
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui3-claim
*Size*:: 1 GiB

Click `Create`.  You will now be returned to the previous screen to complete the task of Add Storage.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-storage-details.png[Storage Details]
====

Use the following parameters.

.Key-Values for Storage Details
[horizontal]
*Storage*:: hello-webui3-claim
*Mount Path*:: /var/www/html

Click `Add`.  Openshift will now initiate a redployment of our app using the new configuration which includes NFS storage.

==== Expose Route

Mouse-over and select *Applications->Routes*

Click `Create Route`

Fill in the details as follows (using defaults unless specified otherwise).

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui3
*Hostname*:: hello-webui3.cloud.example.com

Click `Create`

==== Verify

Mouse-over `Application` and select `Routes`.  Click on the URL provided in the Hostname column.  You should get the helloworld output.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-verification.png[Verification]
====

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// --- Authentic Solution #4
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Solution #4: Use Source Control (git)


==== Create a Project

Go To Front Landing Page and select `Create Project`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui4
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI IV
*Description*:: My Fourth WebUI App

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right of the display and that your current project has been set as well.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

==== Create an Application

Using the Search bar, search for *httpd* and select the *QUICKSTART HTTPD* result.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello4-image-search.png[Image Search]
====

You will then be presented with an overview of the container image. Select `Next` to move to the application configuration data entry dialog.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello4-image-details.png[Image Details]
====

Now you are presented with a series of options to configure the applicaton.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello4-app-details.png[Application Details]
====

Entering details using defaults for all values unless specified below:

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Add to Project*:: Hello WebUI IV
*Name*:: hello-webui4
*Git Repository URL*:: https://github.com/xtophd/OCP-Workshop
*Context Directory*:: /src/helloworld
*Application Hostname*:: hello-webui4.cloud.example.com

Once you have filled in the details, select **Create**

Now let's have a closer inspection.  

Click "Continue to Project Overview"

// --- Authentic Solution #5 ------------------------------------------
=== Solution #5: Use Dockerfile

So this solution is a bit more complicated.  As shown during the CLI exercises, deploying an application
based on a Dockerfile is pretty trivial.  In fact, the `oc new-app` commandline was the shortest and had the least amount of typing of all the CLI helloworld examples.

Using the WebUI, there is currently no method to natively invoke a *Docker Build Strategy*.  Thus we are left with the option of importing a YAML configuration file.  Once again, this workshop has provided a sample file to make the exercise fairly simply to execute.  However, we are going to spend some time discussing it in detail.  This will hopefully shed some light on how Openshift (ie: Kubernettes) functions.

First let us begin with how this YAML file was built.  That's simple, we used the `oc new-app` CLI tool.

.[root@workstation ~]#
----
oc login master:8443 -u admin
     
oc new-app https://github.com/xtophd/OCP-Workshop --context-dir=/src/dockerfile --name=hello-webui5 --dry-run -o yaml
----

The output of the above command is listed below.  Step through it and notice the individual stanzas (denoted by the leading '-').  There are sections for: 

  * ImageStream (for the source base php image)
  * ImageStream (for the final deployable image (ie: output))
  * BuildConfig
  ** note "dockerStrategy"
  ** note dockerStrategy "from"
  ** note git "uri" and "contextDir"
  ** note the "output"
  * DeploymentConfig
  ** note the number of "replicas"
  ** note the reference to the "image", the "ports"
  ** note the triggers
  * Service

The reasons for noting specific items in each stanza is simply to point out the relationships between them.
The only step (definition) missing to having a completely deployed application at the end of ingesting this YAML is the exposed *route* which connects the outside world to the pod's *service*.

Review the output below and discuss each section.  Then proceed to the steps towards deploying the application.
