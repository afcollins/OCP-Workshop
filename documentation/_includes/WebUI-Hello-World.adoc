= WebUI: Hello World

This unit will mimic (as closely as possible) the exerices done in the CLI version of Hello World.

The objective is to step through everything needed to bring a "Hello, World!" program online in our Openshift Container Platform. Again, we are going to do it several different ways to illustrate some best and worst practices of container usage.

There are 4 fundamental steps to deploying an application in the Openshift Container Platform via the WebUI:

  . **login** - sign-on with proper credentials
  . **Create a Project**
  . **Create an Application**
  . **Expose a Route**

Let's get started.

== My First Application

=== Sign-on as admin

Please proceed to login to the Openshift WebUI as user *admin*.  Instructions for doing so are outlined in the unit *WebUI: First Time Login*.

====
image::ocp-webui-login-04.png[Login]
====

=== Create a Project

Go To Front Landing Page and select `Create Project`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI
*Description*:: My First WebUI App

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right.  Now select the new `HelloWebUI` project from the list on the right to continue to the next step.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-select.png[Select Project]
====

=== Create an Application

The next step is to select `Deploy Image`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-image-deploy.png[Image Deploy]
====

Next you will be prompted for image name.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-image-name.png[Image Name]
====

Click the radio button next to `Image Name` and enter the values as shown below.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

Click the `Search` icon to advance to the final phase of this deployment.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-resource-name.png[Resource Name]
====

Now you are presented with a description of the specified image.  Scroll down a bit and change the *Name* as shown below.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui

Click `Deploy` and then `Continue to Project Overview`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-overview.png[Project Overview]
====

You just completed instructing Openshift to create a new application called **webui-hello** based on a container image being pulled from registry.access.redhat.com.

=== Expose a Route

Time to configure a **route** and expose our new application to the network.  On the left menu, mouse-over `Applications` and proceed to `Routes`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-routes.png[Application Routes]
====

Proceed to click on `Create Route`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-route-create.png[Create Route]
====

After clicking on `Create Route` you will be prompted for some details.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-route-details.png[Create Route]
====

Fill in the details as follows (using defaults unless specified otherwise).

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui
*Hostname*:: hello-webui.cloud.example.com

Proceed to click `Create`.  You should be returned to the Routes Overview page as shown.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-routes-overview.png[Create Route]
====

=== Validate Application

You can now click on the URL provided in the **Hostname** column to verify that the application is working as expected.  You should see the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux Test Page.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-verification.png[Application Verification]
====

=== Exploring the Container

On the left menu, mouse-over `Applications` and proceed to `Pods`.  Now click on the pod link to bring up it's details.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-pod-overview.png[Pod Overview]
====

One of the options in the pod details is to connect to the active pods terminal.  Proceed to click on `Terminal`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-pod-terminal.png[Pod Overview]
====

Now that you have connected to the active container, have a look around.  These are identical exercises to those performed in the CLI version of hellow-world.  If you are familiar with the terminal activites you can skip to **Making an authentic "Hello, World!"**.

Here are a few commands to explore the container's namespace (ie: environment).

.sh-4.2$

----

Normally files serverd by httpd go into /var/www/html, but the security-conscious random uid does not have permissions to write to this directory (or any other directory than the tmp dirs).

.sh-4.2$
----
cd /var/www/
    
ls -la
----

.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]
----
total 0
drwxr-xr-x.  4 default root  33 Jul 17 17:12 .
drwxr-xr-x. 19 root    root 249 Jul 17 17:13 ..
drwxr-xr-x.  2 default root   6 May  9 13:18 cgi-bin
drwxr-xr-x.  2 default root   6 May  9 13:18 html
----


The primary thing we are trying to point out here is that the UID the process is running with (ie: **1000120000**) does not have permissions to write to any part of the container filesystem except traditionally open directories like **/tmp** or **/var/tmp**.  Next, you will do a series of exercises detailing how to make adjustments to the project and deploy a real helloworld application.

== Making an authentic "Hello, World!"

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// --- Authentic Solution #1
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Solution #1: Change Security Attribute

The Openshift WebUI does not provide a native dialog for modifying all project attributes.  So, for this first objective you are either left with steps outlined in the CLI Helloworld exercises (ie: *oc edit namespace webui-hello*) OR using the `Import YAML/JSON` functionality of the WebUI.  

For our first solution, we are going to adjust the current project's security attribute by importing a YAML config file.

Proceed to click on the left side `Overview` tab.  The main bar across the top should still show **Hello WebUI** as our selected project.   In the upper right corner you should see a pull-down labeled `Add to Project`.  From there, select `Import YAML/JSON`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-add-to-project.png[Add To Project]
====

Now you can either type in the YAML configuration file, but for convenience one has been provided.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-yaml-import.png[Import YAML]
====

User the `Browse` button to find and load the following file.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Filename*:: /var/tmp/webui-hello-namespace.txt

Once the file has been loaded, proceed to click on `Create`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-yaml-create.png[Import YAML Create]
====
    
A Confirmation dialog will appear to which we will simply clink on `Replace`.

Now click on `Close` and you will be returned to the project overview page.

The last task to complete the image configuration is to initiate a new deployment.  For that you click on the three vertical dots on the far right of the depolyment configuration, and select `Deploy`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-redeploy.png[Re-Deploy]
====
    
Finally, you can use the `Terminal` feature found in the **Pod** Overview page.  From there you can access the shell, poke around and install a helloworld **index.html**.

.sh-4.2$
----
curl helloworld3.cloud.example.com > /var/www/html/index.html
----

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-verification2.png[Verification]

IMPORTANT: The solution you just completed is NOT a recommended solution on how to deploy a container for production use.  This solution was provided to touch on a few concepts unique to the Openshift Container Platform.  Take some time to review: container design, project attributes, process uid/gid (ie: namespaces) in a containerized environment, filesystems, etc...

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// --- Authentic Solution #2
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Solution #2: Use emptyDir

We being this solution by repeating the steps to deploy a httpd base image.

=== Create a Project

Go To Front Landing Page and select `Create Project`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui2
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI II
*Description*:: My Second WebUI App

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right.  Now select the new `Wello WebUI II` project from the list on the right to continue to the next step.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

=== Create an Application

The next step is to select `Deploy Image` and fill in the following details.

Click the radio button next to `Image Name` and enter the values as shown below.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

Click the `Search` icon to advance to the final phase of this deployment.

Now you are presented with a description of the specified image.  Scroll down a bit and change the *Name* as shown below.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui2

Click `Deploy` and then `Continue to Project Overview`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-project-overview.png[Project Overview]
====

You just completed instructing Openshift to create a new application called **webui-hello** based on a container image being pulled from registry.access.redhat.com.

=== Expose a Route

Time to configure a **route** and expose our new application to the network.  On the left menu, mouse-over `Applications` and proceed to `Routes`.

Proceed to click on `Create Route`.

After clicking on `Create Route` you will be prompted for some details.

Fill in the details as follows (using defaults unless specified otherwise).

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui2
*Hostname*:: hello-webui.cloud.example.com

Proceed to click `Create`.  You should be returned to the Routes Overview page as shown.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-routes-overview.png[Create Route]
====

Mouse over `Applications` and proceed to `Deployments`

Select the `hello-webui2` deployment

From the `Actions` pull-down, select `Edit Yaml`

In the Edit block, scroll down to line 44 or thereabouts and find **namd: hello-webui2**.  On the next line, insert the following block:

.Edit YAML File
[source,indent=4]
----
volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /var/www/html
    name: hellow-webui2-vol
----

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-yaml-edit1.png[YAML Edit 1]
====

Now scroll down to line 60 or thereabouts and find **terminationGracePeriodSeconds**.  On the next line, insert the following block:

.Edit YAML File Continued
[source,indent=4]
----
volumes:
  - name: hello-webui2-vol
    emptyDir: {}
----

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-yaml-edit2.png[YAML Edit 2]
====

Now scroll to the bottomw and select `Save`.  Updating the deployment configuation like this will automatically trigger a new deployment of our application.

Mouse over `Applications` and select `Pods`.

Select the Pod and then use the `Terminal` feature found in the **Pod** Overview page.  From there you can access the shell and install a helloworld **index.html** as shown below.

.sh-4.2$
----
curl helloworld3.cloud.example.com > /var/www/html/index.html
----

Mission accomplisheded.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-verification2.png[Verification]
====

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// --- Authentic Solution #3
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Solution #3: Use NFS

==== Create Project

Start at the Openshift landing page and `Create` a project as before.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui3
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI III
*Description*:: My Third WebUI App

Once the project is created, proceed to select the project on the right.

==== Create Persistent Volume (PV)

Persistent Volumes are "cluster" objects and thus are not namespaced (ie: they don't belong to projects alone).  The WebUI also does not currently provide a dialog for creating PVs.  This action will be performed by importing a YAML configuration file similar to what was does in the CLI counterpart to this exercise.

Proceed to click `Import YAML/JSON`.  You can select either the button in the center of the screen, or the option from the **Add to Project** pull down.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-yaml-import.png[Import YAML]
====

A sample YAML file is provided on the workstation to make this process easy.  Use the `Browse` button on the search bar to locate: **/var/tmp/nfs-pv-02.txt**

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-yaml-pv.png[Create PV]
====

Proceed to click on `Create`.  You will get a warning message requesting confirmation, click `Create Anyway`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-yaml-confirmation.png[Confirm PV]
====

Now click on `Close" and continue with your image deployment.

==== Create Application

As before, the next step is to `Deploy Image`

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-yaml-import.png[Import YAML]
====

.Key-Values for Deploy Image
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

After typing in the Image Name, click the search icon to populate the image details and expose additional options.

Scroll down and change the application name as follows.

Since there are no PVC's available for use, you will be directed to the Create Storage page.

After you click on `Create Storage` you will be presented a dialog for setting up a persistent volume claim (PVC).

====
image::ocp-webui-hello3-storage-pvc.png[Create Storage]
====

Use the following parameters.

.Key-Values for Create Storage
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui3-claim
*Size*:: 1 GiB

Click `Create`.  You will now be returned to the previous screen to complete the task of Add Storage.
