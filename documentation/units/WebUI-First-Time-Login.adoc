= Openshift WebUI Basics

== Sign-on

NOTE:  you will NOT be able to login to the WebUI until you have created a admin account as detailed in the CLI: Users and Roles unit.  If you have not performed those sets, please take a moment to complete that exercise first.

Use Firefox on the designated *workstation* to connect to the following URL:

https://master.example.com:8443[]

If this is the first time connecting to the Openshift WebUI (especially in a lab environment like this) you will probably be notified of an "Insecure Connection" as shown below.  Please proceed to click on the `Advanced` button.
