= WebUI: Hello World

This unit will mimic (as closely as possible) the exerices done in the CLI version of Hello World.

The objective is to step through everything needed to bring a "Hello, World!" program online in our Openshift Container Platform. Again, we are going to do it several different ways to illustrate some best and worst practices of container usage.

There are 4 fundamental steps to deploying an application in the Openshift Container Platform via the WebUI:

  . **login** - sign-on with proper credentials
  . **create project**
  . **create application**
  . **expose route**

Let's get started.

== My First Application

=== Sign-on as admin

Please proceed to login to the Openshift WebUI as user *admin*.  Instructions for doing so are outlined in the unit *WebUI: First Time Login*.

====

====

=== Create a Project

Go To Front Landing Page and select `Create Project`

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-01-create-project.png[Create Project]
====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello
*Display Name*:: WebUI Hello World
*Description*:: {leave blank}

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right.  Now select the new `WebUI Hello World` project from the list on the right to continue to the next step.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

====

====

=== Create an Application

The next step is to select `Deploy Image`.

====

====

Next you will be prompted for image name.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-04-image-name.png[Image Name]
====

Click the radio button next to `Image Name` and enter the values as shown below.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

Click the `Search` icon to advance to the final phase of this deployment.

====

====

Now you are presented with a description of the specified image.  Scroll down a bit and change the *Name* as shown below.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello

Click `Deploy` and then `Continue to Project Overview`

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-06-app-overview.png[Application Overview]
====

You just completed instructing Openshift to create a new application called **webui-hello** based on a container image being pulled from registry.access.redhat.com.

=== Add a Route

Now it is time to configure a **route** and expose our new application to the network.  On the left menu, mouse-over `Applications` and proceed to `Routes`.
====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-07-app-routes.png[Application Routes]
====

After clicking on `Create Route` you will be prompted for some details.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-08-routes-create.png[Create Route]
====

Fill in the details as follows (using defaults unless specified otherwise).

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello

Proceed to click `Create`.  You should be returned to the Routes Overview page as shown.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-09-routes-overview.png[Routes Overview]
====

You can now click on the URL provided in the **Hostname** column to verify that the application is working as expected.  You should see the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux Test Page.

== Making an authentic "Hello, World!"

// --- Authentic Solution #1 ------------------------------------------
=== Solution #1: Change Security Attribute


// --- Authentic Solution #2 ------------------------------------------
=== Solution #2: Use emptyDir


// --- Authentic Solution #3 ------------------------------------------
=== Solutino #3: Use NFS



// --- Authentic Solution #4 ------------------------------------------
=== Solution #4: Use Source Control (git)


==== Create a Project

Go To Front Landing Page and select `Create Project`

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello4
*Display Name*:: WebUI Hello World 4
*Description*:: {leave blank}

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right of the display and that your current project has been set as well.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

==== Create an Application

Using the Search bar, search for *httpd* and select the *QUICKSTART HTTPD* result.

You will then be presented with an overview of the container image. Select `Next` to move to the application configuration data entry dialog.

Now you are presented with a series of options to configure the applicaton.

Now entering details using defaults for all values unless specified below:

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Add to Project*:: WebUI Hello World 4
*Name*:: webui-hello4
*Git Repository URL*:: https://github.com/xtophd/OCP-Workshop
*Context Directory*:: /src/helloworld
*Application Hostname*:: webui-hello4.cloud.example.com

Once you have filled in the details, select **Create**

Now let's have a closer inspection.
