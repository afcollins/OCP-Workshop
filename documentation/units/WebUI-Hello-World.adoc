= WebUI: Hello World

This unit will mimic (as closely as possible) the exerices done in the CLI version of Hello World.

The objective is to step through everything needed to bring a "Hello, World!" program online in our Openshift Container Platform. Again, we are going to do it several different ways to illustrate some best and worst practices of container usage.

There are 4 fundamental steps to deploying an application in the Openshift Container Platform via the WebUI:

  . **login** - sign-on with proper credentials
  . **Create a Project**
  . **Create an Application**
  . **Expose a Route**

Let's get started.

== My First Application

=== Sign-on as admin

Please proceed to login to the Openshift WebUI as user *admin*.  Instructions for doing so are outlined in the unit *WebUI: First Time Login*.

====
image::ocp-webui-login-04.png[Login]
====

=== Create a Project

Go To Front Landing Page and select `Create Project`

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-01-create-project.png[Create Project]
====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello
*Display Name*:: WebUI Hello World
*Description*:: {leave blank}

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right.  Now select the new `WebUI Hello World` project from the list on the right to continue to the next step.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-02-select-project.png[Select Project]
====

=== Create an Application

The next step is to select `Deploy Image`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-03-image-deploy.png[Image Deploy]
====

Next you will be prompted for image name.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-04-image-name.png[Image Name]
====

Click the radio button next to `Image Name` and enter the values as shown below.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

Click the `Search` icon to advance to the final phase of this deployment.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-05-resource-name.png[Resource Name]
====

Now you are presented with a description of the specified image.  Scroll down a bit and change the *Name* as shown below.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello

Click `Deploy` and then `Continue to Project Overview`

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-06-app-overview.png[Application Overview]
====

You just completed instructing Openshift to create a new application called **webui-hello** based on a container image being pulled from registry.access.redhat.com.

=== Expose a Route

Now it is time to configure a **route** and expose our new application to the network.  On the left menu, mouse-over `Applications` and proceed to `Routes`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-07-app-routes.png[Application Routes]
====

After clicking on `Create Route` you will be prompted for some details.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-08-routes-create.png[Create Route]
====

Fill in the details as follows (using defaults unless specified otherwise).

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello
*Hostname*:: webui-hello.cloud.example.com

Proceed to click `Create`.  You should be returned to the Routes Overview page as shown.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-09-routes-overview.png[Routes Overview]
====

=== Validate Application

You can now click on the URL provided in the **Hostname** column to verify that the application is working as expected.  You should see the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux Test Page.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-10-verification.png[Verification]
====

=== Exploring the Container

On the left menu, mouse-over `Applications` and proceed to `Pods`.  Now click on the pod link to bring up it's details.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-11-pod-overview.png[Pod Overview]
====

One of the options in the pod details is to connect to the active pods terminal.  Proceed to click on `Terminal`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-12-pod-terminal.png[Pod Terminal]
====

Now that you have connected to the active container, have a look around.  These are identical exercises to those performed in the CLI version of hellow-world.  If you are familiar with the terminal activites you can skip to **Making an authentic "Hello, World!"**.

Here are a few commands to explore the container's namespace (ie: environment).

.sh-4.2$

----

Normally files serverd by httpd go into /var/www/html, but the security-conscious random uid does not have permissions to write to this directory (or any other directory than the tmp dirs).

.sh-4.2$
----
cd /var/www/
    
ls -la
----

.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]
----
total 0
drwxr-xr-x.  4 default root  33 Jul 17 17:12 .
drwxr-xr-x. 19 root    root 249 Jul 17 17:13 ..
drwxr-xr-x.  2 default root   6 May  9 13:18 cgi-bin
drwxr-xr-x.  2 default root   6 May  9 13:18 html
----


The primary thing we are trying to point out here is that the UID the process is running with (ie: **1000120000**) does not have permissions to write to any part of the container filesystem except traditionally open directories like **/tmp** or **/var/tmp**.  Next, you will do a series of exercises detailing how to make adjustments to the project and deploy a real helloworld application.

== Making an authentic "Hello, World!"

// --- Authentic Solution #1 ------------------------------------------
=== Solution #1: Change Security Attribute


// --- Authentic Solution #2 ------------------------------------------
=== Solution #2: Use emptyDir


// --- Authentic Solution #3 ------------------------------------------
=== Solutino #3: Use NFS

==== Create Project

Start at the Openshift landing page and `Create` a project as before.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-01-create-project.png[Create Project]
====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello3
*Display Name*:: WebUI Hello 3
*Description*:: {leave blank}

Once the project is created, proceed to select the project on the right.

==== Create Persistent Volume (PV)

Persistent Volumes are "cluster" objects and thus are not namespaced (ie: they don't belong to projects alone).  The WebUI also does not currently provide a dialog for creating PVs.  This action will be performed by importing a YAML configuration file similar to what was does in the CLI counterpart to this exercise.

Proceed to click `Import YAML/JSON`.  You can select either the button in the center of the screen, or the option from the **Add to Project** pull down.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw3-02-pv-import-yaml.png[Import YAML]
====

A sample YAML file is provided on the workstation to make this process easy.  Use the `Browse` button on the search bar to locate: **/var/tmp/nfs-pv-02.txt**

====
image::ocp-webui-hw3-03-pv-yaml.png[YAML Details]
====

Proceed to click on `Create`.  You will get a warning message requesting confirmation, click `Create Anyway`

====
image::ocp-webui-hw3-04-pv-confirmation.png[PV Confirmation]
====

Now click on `Close" and continue with your image deployment.

==== Create Application

As before, the next step is to `Deploy Image`

====
image::ocp-webui-hw1-03-image-deploy.png[Image Deploy]
====

.Key-Values for Deploy Image
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

After typing in the Image Name, click the search icon to populate the image details and expose additional options.

Scroll down and change the application name as follows.

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello3

Now click 'Deploy' and **Continue to the project overview**.

==== Create Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

Go to the deployments page and select our deployment configuration **wehui-hello3**.

Now click on the `Actions` pull down and select `Add Storage`.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw3-05-add-storage.png[Add Storage]
====

After you click on `Create Storage` you will be presented the dialog for setting up a persistent volume claim (PVC).

====
image::ocp-webui-hw3-06-create-storage.png[Add Storage]
====

Use the following parameters.

.Key-Values for Create Storage
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello3-claim
*Size*:: 1 GiB

Click `Create`.  You will now be returned to the previous screen to complete the task of Add Storage.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw3-07-storage-details.png[Add Storage]
====

Use the following parameters.

.Key-Values for Storage Details
[horizontal]
*Storage*:: webui-hello3-claim
*Mount Path*:: /var/www/html

Click `Add`.  Openshift will no initiate a redplyment of our app with the new configuration which includes NFS storage.

==== Expose Route

Go to Applications-> Routes and proceed to click `Create Route`

Fill in the details as follows (using defaults unless specified otherwise).

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello3
*Hostname*:: webui-hello3.cloud.example.com

Click `Create`

==== Verify

From the Application/Routes page, click on the URL provided in the Hostname column.

==== Create a Project

Go To Front Landing Page and select `Create Project`

====
image::ocp-webui-hw4-01-create-project.png[Create Project]
====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello4
*Display Name*:: WebUI Hello World 4
*Description*:: {leave blank}

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right of the display and that your current project has been set as well.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

==== Create an Application

Using the Search bar, search for *httpd* and select the *QUICKSTART HTTPD* result.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw4-02-image-search.png[Create Project]
====

You will then be presented with an overview of the container image. Select `Next` to move to the application configuration data entry dialog.

====
image::ocp-webui-hw4-03-image-details.png[Image Details]
====

Now you are presented with a series of options to configure the applicaton.
