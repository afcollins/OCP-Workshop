*Name*:: webui-hello1
*Display Name*:: WebUI Hello 1
*Description*:: {leave blank}

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right of the display and that your current project has been set as well.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

== Create an Application from a Container Image and GIT

Now entering details using defaults for all values unless specified below:

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Add to Project*:: WebUI Hello World
*Name*:: webui-hello1
*Git Repository URL*:: https://github.com/xtophd/OCP-Workshop
*Context Directory*:: /src/helloworld
*Application Hostname*:: webui-hello1.cloud.example.com

Once you have filled in the details, select **Create**


You just instructed openship to create a new application called **webui-hello**:
  - The container was deployed to a node and brought online.

Now let's have a closer inspection.  

Click "Continue to Project Overview"

=== Inspect the Deployments

=== Inspect the Pods

=== Inspect the Services

=== Inpects the Routes

=== Validate the Application

Create and use a new Tab in Firefox to view your new application.  The link should be http://webui-hello1.cloud.example.com





```
: [root@master ~]#

oc status
    
oc get pods
    
oc get services
```

The IP address shown for the service is the internal non-routable network for the pod.  From any node in the cluster, we can test the pod for application functionality before exposing the service to the public. 

```
: [root@master ~]#

curl -Is http://{ip_address}}:8080
```

== Add a Route

Routers are the processes responsible for making services accessible to the outside world, so the routers must be reachable. Routers run as containers on nodes - therefore, the nodes where routers run must be reachable themselves.


== Validate Application
