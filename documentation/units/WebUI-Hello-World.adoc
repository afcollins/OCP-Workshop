= WebUI: Hellow World

This unit will mimic (as closely as possible) the exerices done in the CLI version of Hello World.

The objective is to step through everything needed to bring a "Hello, World!" program online in our Openshift Container Platform. Again, we are going to do it several different ways to illustrate some best and worst practices of container usage.

There are 4 fundamental steps to deploying an application in the Openshift Container Platform via the WebUI:

  . **login** - sign-on with proper credentials
  . **create project**
  . **create application**
  . **expose route**

Let's get started.

== My First Application

=== Sign-on as admin

Please proceed to login to the Openshift WebUI as user *admin*.  Instructions for doing so are outlined in the unit *WebUI: First Time Login*.

=== Create a Project

Go To Front Landing Page and select `Create Project`

====

Fill in the details as follows:

.Key-Values for Create Project Dialog
[horizontal]
*Name*:: webui-hello
*Display Name*:: WebUI Hello
*Description*:: {leave blank}

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right of the display and that your current project has been set as well.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

=== Create an Application

Using the Search bar, search for *httpd* and select the *QUICKSTART HTTPD* result.

You will then be presented with an overview of the container image. Select `Next` to move to the application configuration data entry dialog.

Now entering details using defaults for all values unless specified below:

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Add to Project*:: WebUI Hello World
*Name*:: webui-hello
*Application Hostname*:: webui-hello.cloud.example.com

Once you have filled in the details, select **Create**


You just instructed openship to create a new application called **webui-hello**:
  - The container was deployed to a node and brought online.

And now click `Create`.  You should notice that your new project has been added to the list on the right of the display and that your current project has been set as well.  The current project is denoted in the top left hand corner.

==== Create an Application from a Container Image and GIT

Using the Search bar, search for *httpd* and select the *QUICKSTART HTTPD* result.

You will then be presented with an overview of the container image. Select `Next` to move to the application configuration data entry dialog.

Now you are presented with a series of options to configure the applicaton.

Now entering details using defaults for all values unless specified below:

.Key-Values for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Add to Project*:: WebUI Hello World 4
*Name*:: webui-hello4
*Git Repository URL*:: https://github.com/xtophd/OCP-Workshop
*Context Directory*:: /src/helloworld
*Application Hostname*:: webui-hello4.cloud.example.com

Once you have filled in the details, select **Create**

Now let's have a closer inspection.  

Click "Continue to Project Overview"

=== Inspect the Deployments

=== Inspect the Pods

=== Inspect the Services

=== Inpects the Routes

=== Validate the Application

Create and use a new Tab in Firefox to view your new application.  The link should be http://webui-hello1.cloud.example.com
