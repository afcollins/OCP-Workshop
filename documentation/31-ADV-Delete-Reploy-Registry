*These steps merely delete and redeploy a registry with default settings*

Likewise, delete and recreate a registry.

    [root@master master]#  oc get pods
    [root@master master]#  oc delete all -l docker-registry=default
    [root@master master]#  oc get pods
    [root@master master]#  oc adm registry
    [root@master master]#  oc get pods
